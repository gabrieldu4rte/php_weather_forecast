<h1>Weather Forecast</h1>
<p>This project uses the Weather API to create a weather forecast panel, according to the selected city. When selecting the city from a pre-defined list of cities, the application provides the user with the current weather, with data such as the current temperature in degrees Celsius, and the weather forecast for the next 5 days, including the current day.</p>
